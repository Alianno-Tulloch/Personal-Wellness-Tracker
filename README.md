# Inspiration for the Project
My inspiration for making this was pretty funny. One day I spent the entire day gaming, and I felt miserable. The next day I spent the whole day doing learning French, and I felt amazing. When I was laying in bed that night, I thought to myself "Man, I felt a lot better accomplishing the goals I set out for myself than I felt wasting an entire day playing video games. If only I had some way to empirically remind myself of that the next time I feel like doing nothing for a full day."

And then it hit me. Why don't I just make an app that records how I feel each day, and then shows the correlation between my mood and my daily activities and health.
